### [US Census Median Household Income Visualized By Tract](https://github.com/KJZou56/us_census_median_household_income_visualized_by_tract)

Real estate invesment is hyper local. This is why it is very important to go down to US census tract. As a real estate investor, you don't want to only know which state or county to invest in, but specific neighborhood or area that you want to target.

The goal of this project is show how to get US census tracts and median income for the US census, and, plot it for better visulization of local trends and patterns.

Think of it like zooming in on a map. Counties and states are like whole continents, while census tracts are like city districts. By zooming in, you can see the finer details and patterns that might be hidden at a larger scale.

### [Build Classification Algorithms for Digital Transformation](https://github.com/KJZou56/digital-transformation)

Bank XYZ has a growing customer base where the majority of them are liability customers (depositors) vs. borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding the borrowerâ€™s base rapidly to bring in more business via loan interests.

A campaign that the bank ran in the last quarter showed an average single-digit conversion rate. In the last town hall, the marketing head mentioned that digital transformation is the core strength of the business strategy, how to devise effective campaigns with better target marketing to increase the conversion ratio to double-digit with the same budget as per the last campaign.

The aim is to build a machine learning model to perform focused digital marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert from liability customers to asset customers.

### [Predictive Analytics Project for Working Capital Optimization](https://github.com/KJZou56/Working-Capital-Optimization)

Working capital optimization involves strategically managing a company's current assets and liabilities to enhance operational efficiency and financial health. It focuses on finding the right balance between accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) to ensure sufficient liquidity while minimizing costs and risks.

The project aims to optimize working capital management by leveraging accounts receivable and payable data. Through predictive analysis, the project aims to accurately forecast the timing of customer and supplier payments, enabling the company to ensure cash flow and liquidity within a specified period.

### [Machine Learning project for Retail Price Optimization](https://github.com/KJZou56/price-optimization)

Pricing a product is a crucial aspect of any business. A lot of thought process is put into it. There are different strategies to estimate prices for different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are pretty sensitive to their costs, and as such, a slight change in their price can lead to a noticeable difference in their sales. At the same time, there are also products whose sales are not much affected by their prices - these tend to be luxury items or necessities (like certain medicines). 

In this machine learning pricing optimization case study, we will take the data of a cafe and, based on their past sales, identify the optimal prices for their items based on the price elasticity of the items to maximize the profit.

### [Credit card fraud as a classification problem](https://github.com/KJZou56/credit-card-fraud-detection)

Like any other technology that has been introduced in the world, the internet also comes with pros and cons. All of us enjoy the pros as the internet has changed our lifestyle by enhancing our communication. But, at the same time, we are witnessing digital frauds, which include fraudulent transactions through stolen credit cards. Credit card companies must identify fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. And this project is all about detecting such fraudulent transactions with the help of customers' attributes and transactions information.

Such problems can be tackled with Data Science along with Machine Learning, and its importance cannot be overstated. This project intends to illustrate the modelling of a data set using machine learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection.
