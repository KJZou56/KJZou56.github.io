A US census tract is a small, relatively permanent geographic subdivision within a county (or similar statistical entity). Here's why they're valuable for analysis compared to counties or states:

Granularity 🔍: Counties and states are large areas, and data within them can be quite diverse. Census tracts provide a more focused view, allowing you to analyze smaller areas with more homogenous populations or characteristics.

Targeted Analysis 🎯: This finer detail helps you delve deeper into specific neighborhoods or communities within a larger region.

Comparisons 🏘️: You can compare data across different census tracts within a county or even across metropolitan areas to identify trends or variations.

Standardization 🧐: Census tracts are delineated consistently across the US, making them ideal for standardized comparisons between different locations.

Think of it like zooming in on a map. Counties and states are like whole continents, while census tracts are like city districts. By zooming in, you can see the finer details and patterns that might be hidden at a larger scale.

### [Build Classification Algorithms for Digital Transformation](https://github.com/KJZou56/digital-transformation)

Bank XYZ has a growing customer base where the majority of them are liability customers (depositors) vs. borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding the borrower’s base rapidly to bring in more business via loan interests.

A campaign that the bank ran in the last quarter showed an average single-digit conversion rate. In the last town hall, the marketing head mentioned that digital transformation is the core strength of the business strategy, how to devise effective campaigns with better target marketing to increase the conversion ratio to double-digit with the same budget as per the last campaign.

The aim is to build a machine learning model to perform focused digital marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert from liability customers to asset customers.

### [Predictive Analytics Project for Working Capital Optimization](https://github.com/KJZou56/Working-Capital-Optimization)

Working capital optimization involves strategically managing a company's current assets and liabilities to enhance operational efficiency and financial health. It focuses on finding the right balance between accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) to ensure sufficient liquidity while minimizing costs and risks.

The project aims to optimize working capital management by leveraging accounts receivable and payable data. Through predictive analysis, the project aims to accurately forecast the timing of customer and supplier payments, enabling the company to ensure cash flow and liquidity within a specified period.

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, seaborn, scikit-learn, pyodbc

### [Machine Learning project for Retail Price Optimization](https://github.com/KJZou56/price-optimization)

Pricing a product is a crucial aspect of any business. A lot of thought process is put into it. There are different strategies to estimate prices for different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are pretty sensitive to their costs, and as such, a slight change in their price can lead to a noticeable difference in their sales. At the same time, there are also products whose sales are not much affected by their prices - these tend to be luxury items or necessities (like certain medicines). 

In this machine learning pricing optimization case study, we will take the data of a cafe and, based on their past sales, identify the optimal prices for their items based on the price elasticity of the items to maximize the profit.

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, seaborn

### [Credit card fraud as a classification problem](https://github.com/KJZou56/credit-card-fraud-detection)

Like any other technology that has been introduced in the world, the internet also comes with pros and cons. All of us enjoy the pros as the internet has changed our lifestyle by enhancing our communication. But, at the same time, we are witnessing digital frauds, which include fraudulent transactions through stolen credit cards. Credit card companies must identify fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. And this project is all about detecting such fraudulent transactions with the help of customers' attributes and transactions information.

Such problems can be tackled with Data Science and its importance, along with Machine Learning, cannot be overstated. This project intends to illustrate the modelling of a data set using machine learning with Credit Card Fraud Detection.

Language: Python
