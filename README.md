### [Build Classification Algorithms for Digital Transformation](https://github.com/KJZou56/digital-transformation)

Bank XYZ has a growing customer base where the majority of them are liability customers (depositors) vs. borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding the borrower’s base rapidly to bring in more business via loan interests.

A campaign that the bank ran in the last quarter showed an average single-digit conversion rate. In the last town hall, the marketing head mentioned that digital transformation is the core strength of the business strategy, how to devise effective campaigns with better target marketing to increase the conversion ratio to double-digit with the same budget as per the last campaign.

The aim is to build a machine learning model to perform focused digital marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert from liability customers to asset customers.

Language: Python

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, pickle, imblearn
